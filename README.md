# Etch-A-Sketch 🎨

A browser-based sketch pad inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app lets you draw by hovering your mouse over a grid. You can resize the grid, switch between black and rainbow color modes, and clear your artwork with a single click.
